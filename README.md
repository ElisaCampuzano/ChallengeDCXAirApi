# ChallengeDCXAirApi

A clean architecture was used in the backend of the DCXAir challenge.
This implementation includes the presentation, domain, application and infrastructure layers. 
Routes were stored in memory, and airport information is also stored.
The necessary services were implemented to obtain the routes according to the parameters sent by the client.
